# DEPRECATED

This has been merged into the [official T-Pot repo](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce/tree/master/cloud/terraform) and will not be maintained.

## T-Pot Terraform

[T-Pot](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce) is a multi-honeypot platform that runs on Ubuntu.

This repository contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) configuration that will allow you to very quickly provision a T-Pot instance on [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). This configuration can be easily extended to support other [providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html) such as [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) if desired.
